Title: Why I Use Exclamation Points With&nbsp;Myself!
Date: December 6, 2022

When I'm taking notes for myself or making a to-do list (boy howdy do I use to-do lists), I sometimes have a tendency to use a lot of exclamation points. A recent example:

It seems like not a big deal, but it's the little things like this that add up. So why do I throw a lot of these exclamation points around in my notes? Three reasons.

1.  I'm excited and I want to express it! I don't like holding back or dampening my expression of any emotions if I don't have to.
2.  It's good when I read it back to remember how excited this thing makes me, and exclamation points elicit excitement!
3.  Retentionnnnn. If I write with the same tone as I'm thinking things, I'll remember the content much more easily later.

I will say, I do avoid talking like this in written text to people who aren't my close friends, just in case they think I'm yelling at them. But otherwise, I sometimes just litter my notes with exclamation points. I'm just really excited all the time! Genuinely!

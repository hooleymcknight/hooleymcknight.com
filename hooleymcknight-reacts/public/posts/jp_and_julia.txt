Title: When the Internet Role Model Couple Breaks&nbsp;Up
Date: November 23, 2022

This is an absolutely ridiculous thing to care about, much less write about, but here I am. JP Saxe and Julia Michaels have broken up, which surprisingly bothers me. I don't really care about or follow along with celebrities lives, it feels a little weird and invasive for me, honestly. They're people, why would I be concerned with their private lives?

But man does this one bother me. I think it's probably coming from the fact that I haven't really had a lot of model relationships around me, ever. My parents aren't divorced or anything nor did they have a bad relationship to my knowledge, but they certainly weren't very open about their relationship with me. They kinda keep that stuff to themselves. I had a close friend once who seemed to have a great relationship, and she was pretty open about it with me and other friends, but...in the end they weren't really all they seemed to be. Mostly on the part of my friend, she actually was really shitty to her partner. That sucked. I'm glad they separated.

Anyway all this to say, I haven't had a role model relationship in my life. And as a human who listens to music and uses Instagram, I had the chance to see the relationship between Julia and JP grow, because they were pretty (respectfully) transparent about things. And I loved it! I loved having some things I could take notes on. I myself am in a very healthy and loving relationship, and I've had a few friends tell me that we're their role model relationship. Relationship goals. Which is really exciting, I'm glad we can be that for someone else. I certainly never had that outside of these two musicians on the internet who I've never met.

Well, JP and Julia have broken up, and it's really confusing for me. I absolutely shouldn't care, it's just a parasocial relationship and I don't know these people. But also, I miss having that surrogate role model relationship to look at. A little silly, but it seems I'm still a human, so, I'll allow it.

I finally got around to listening to both of their songs about the breakup. JP's song has incredible lyrics, and honestly I kinda like them better. It's much less angry and I think I vibe more with that, although I really feel bad for Julia and how she feels. Not knowing the whole story, I'm not sure why JP couldn't figure out how to bridge whatever gap there was, and it seems like they can't figure out why either. Anyway, back to the song. I think the lyrics are fantastic. I mean, it's a JP Saxe song, of course the lyrics are fantastic. He's a lyricist. That's his thing. But it feels weirdly put together. The acoustic versions I've heard on Instagram are better then the recording. Maybe there will be an acoustic version released with better cadence.

So then I listened to Julia's song. *Hoooooly shit!* Julia Michaels can make incredible fucking music, good god. This song is soooo catchy. JP's might have some good lyrics, but I'm only gonna listen to that on a rainy day. Julia Michaels' song is gonna be a standard listen for me. It's just so much fun to listen to! Also, I wish I could sit with her at a bar, cheers to getting on to the next thing, and down some drinks with her.

Here are links to both of the songs, I just wanna state again that Julia's song slaps so fucking hard and I cannot recommend that enough. JP...please re-release, but great lyrics. As always.

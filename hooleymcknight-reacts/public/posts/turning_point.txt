Title: Turning Point in My&nbsp;Life
Date: March 18, 2023

I feel like I had a turning point in my entire life trajectory today. Surely I've had millions of moments like this, but today's was one where I *know* it was big, even though I haven't seen the other side yet.

To avoid going deep into detail, I've been suffering from a particular disease for over half of my life, since I was 14 years old. I've had three minor corrective surgeries and been on medication for all of my adult life to help treat my disease and keep it at bay. Overall, this has failed me. This past Wednesday, I finally got the big "let's give up on treating it and just end this disease" surgery, which I've been fighting to get for years. I've been feeling post-surgery pain for the past several days of course, but a distinct lack of the pain I had before.

Earlier today though, I had a bowel movement. *(Quick aside, if this feels like TMI to you already, you are probably on the wrong website, or at least on the wrong page of this website.)* The thing about bowel movements and surgeries (at least in my experience) is that they fucking suck. They do not go hand in hand. After surgery, it can take several days to have a bowel movement. I absolutely hate being clogged for days; it's miserable. It was one of the things I was dreading the most about this surgery. But today I had the bowel movement, which was the last thing I was waiting for.

And now...I'm fine. Like, that was it. I'm going to be a normal human now. I don't have to suffer from this disease anymore. This has been over half of my life. Constantly worrying about "will I feel okay today" or "what if I spend all day vomiting or having diarrhea" just because of my disease. That's not me anymore. That was some past version of me. Now, I get to wake up and just...live life. This is wild. I'm going to go running, and rock climbing, and play pickleball, and do all the chores in the world, and never worry about how shitty I feel from this disease.

I had my post-surgery pain medicine in a little pill organizer so that even if I was feeling really bad, I could just scoop out the pills based on the labeled time and not even think about it. I unloaded the organizer and put the meds back into their original containers. I don't need them anymore. I'm done with that.

Now I get to be me again, except the last time I was healthy was over 15 years ago. So I get to meet a new version of me. This is an incredibly big day for me. Wow.

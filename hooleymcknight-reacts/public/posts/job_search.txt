Title: My Job Search Stats
Date: April 1, 2023

I'm a big ole nerd and I love making charts and presentations, and gathering data and analyzing stats on things. But not *useful* things necessarily. I wouldn't ever want that to be my day job (although I don't mind if it's sometimes part of it). But I do like to pull up some stats every now and then.

One thing I've been spending a lot of my time doing since I've been laid off is applying for jobs. My sample size is massize; I really do apply for a lot of jobs, minus having taken a health break over the last month. One thing that surprised me which I haven't experienced before in my life during job hunts is that I get ghosted way more often now.

To be clear, I'm not super hurt by this. I know it's not personal and even if it was, the choice to ghost someone is the fault of whoever is doing the ghosting, and not mine. So this isn't personal. But! I am fascinated!! It's such a strange thing to be experiencing in a world where I'm anticipating everyone to be professional and timely, and email back within 48 hours. Then suddenly a month has passed and I still haven't heard back from that one company I interviewed with.

For a plethora of reasons, whenever I'm doing a job hunt, I keep good records of my interactions with every company. At some point when I was talking with friends about how strange the ghosting was, I realized that I already had everything I needed to get some stats together and make a chart. Below is that chart.

I do just want to reiterate again, that this is something I do often. This chart is not coming from a place of bitterness or even exhaustion with the job hunt. I don't feel that way at all. But it's *interesting* and for that reason: pie chart!

Now, to check out the stats:

Of the jobs I applied for, I never heard back from 69.7% of them. This isn't surprising, especially for anyone who's been through a job hunt in the tech industry like this. We all expected this one. Then, 25.2% of the companies got back to me to let me know they weren't interested. Cool! Thanks for letting me know. There's an "other" category which sits at 1%. That's kind of hard to explain but just trust me, they replied but didn't say "no" and also didn't interview me either. Strange but not unheard of. Finally, we have the companies who interviewed me: that would be 4.5% of the jobs I applied for.

Of those companies I interviewed with, a whopping 42.9% of them outright ghosted me. That was super surprising to me. Only 57.1% of the companies proceeded as one might expect, either continuing for further interviews, letting me know they paused hiring for the role (common right now), or letting me know they were going to pass. I realize this is still the majority, but it's a surprisingly low majority. If I've interviewed with a company, I feel like I should be able to see the engagement all the way through to completion, however it goes. But it was very surprising to interview with people and not hear back. I do want to add that I always follow up after interviews, and when a week passed I would follow up again. So it's not all that easy to ghost me. These companies had to ignore at least two emails from me to successfully ghost me.

All that being said, my spirits in the job hunt remain high. Almost surprisingly actually, I feel very optimistic about my search and haven't felt very down about it for a while. Hopefully more fun updates to come soon!

Title: You're the Same You When You're Unemployed
Date: January 11, 2023

Recently I lost my job due to an economy-influenced lay off. This isn't the first time I've experienced this. The first time was back in November of 2018, and I wasn't able to find another industry job for 11 months. That was in my early days, so it makes a bit more sense that it took me so long. I didn't have a lot of experience or skills yet.

This time around, I feel a lot more confident that this lay off won't derail my life quite like the last one did. I've got years of experience under my belt now, and I'm much more confident in my abilities. But even with all that, I'm still scared. And who wouldn't be?

I think I heard it from my therapist, that I'm the same person during an unemployment stretch that I was when I was employed. I'm the same person that previous company decided to hire. Better, in fact. But I didn't magically lose my ability to write code just because I lost my job.

I'm still a good programmer. I'm still a good pet parent. I'm still a good partner. I'm still a good friend. All those things I was before, I still am.

This applies to anyone going through a lay off. I'm well aware of who this blog is for (me, it's for me) so the reach is going to be very small, but I still want to say it. You're still you.

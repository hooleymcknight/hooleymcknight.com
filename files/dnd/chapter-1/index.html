        <h1>Chapter 1: Adrie</h1>

        <p class="reading">
            The creak of a floorboard in the dark snaps me to attention. I was already awake. I’ve been waiting for this.
            <br><br>
            I lay perfectly still in my bed. If there were any moonlight floating down through the window, I would see the dark wooden paneling that covers the stone walls, a cheap attempt to make the room feel more like a home. I would see the wooden trunk in the corner with all my clothes and belongings. Next to my bed, opposite the single door leading in and out, stands a wooden bookshelf. Every year on my birthday, I’m given exactly two books from the library to keep. I have thirty now.
            <br><br>
            Another creak. She’s getting closer now. I feel my breath rise in my chest, and it doesn’t want to leave. I force myself to exhale slowly, quietly. She’s been here so many times before. Why am I still scared?
            <br><br>
            I hear the tink of metal on metal in the doorknob as it slowly rotates, removing the final barrier between her and me. I lay still, silent. The night is still blinding me.
            <br><br>
            The thick wooden door lets out a quick groan as it pivots on its hinges. Again as it pivots back. It isn’t until I hear the release of the doorknob that I finally move.
            <br><br>
            I sit up straight, already on top of the covers. The blanket wrinkles underneath me as I scoot towards the door and let my legs hang off the edge of the bed. I can’t see anything at all.
            <br><br>
            “Sig?” she whispers. I can sense a physical presence, a hand in the dark in front of me. I lift my own shaking hand but don’t reach out.
            <br><br>
            “Adrie,” I breathe, afraid to make any noise louder than that.
            <br><br>
            “It’s me,” Adrie’s voice comes through the dark, a little more confident now. “It’s so dark tonight. This is mad.”
            <br><br>
            “I was afraid you were…” I trail off. My trembling hand inches toward where Adrie is, but I still cannot see her.
            <br><br>
            “I know,” she responds, soothing me with her soft voice. Her hand touches mine and leads my hand up to the side of her face. “I know.”
            <br><br>
            In an instant, I’m on my feet, and my free hand finds her side. Her arms wrap around me; our foreheads touch. I’m barely shaking anymore. I’m finally feeling at home here. I tilt my chin up until our lips meet. Adrie is home to me.
            <br><br>
            We don’t speak much today. I don’t want to, and Adrie understands that. We don’t need any light now that we’ve found each other. I know her body and she knows mine. The only sounds tonight are us.

        <p class="reading">
            When the nightly trance reaches the third hour, the sun has started to rise. Adrie and I are completely intertwined, cuddling. Her head rests on my chest. Her arm is draped across my stomach, her fingers moving lightly over the skin on my ribs. I know she’s wishing there was more flesh there. I could easily change that for her, right now, in this instant. It’s only a deliberate thought away.
            <br><br>
            But it wouldn’t be the truth. It’s not the real me. And I don’t ever want to show Adrie anything that’s not the real me. Even the little things like this. Every little thing is part of who I am. Every bone you can see just a little too well. Every old scar. Every new cut. Every bruise.
            <br><br>
            I hate the way I look. Even for Adrie, it’s hard to look at. But she still wants to, and even though I know it’s hurtful for her to see me, I’ll always love how she looks at me. There’s always a whole team of emotions at play simultaneously, but all of it combines to one thing—Adrie loves me.
            <br><br>
            My train of thought is interrupted when Adrie sits up. I let my hand slide from her shoulder, across her back, and down to the bed. Adrie must have been thinking the same thing, because she turns to look at me now. She looks at my face, my body, my newest bruise on the outside of my upper left arm.
            <br><br>
            “How…” Her voice trails off.
            <br><br>
            “Wooden spoon, in the kitchen,” I tell her.
            <br><br>
            Adrie nods and closes her eyes. I know what’s coming, so I sit up as well. She shuts her eyes tighter and tears crawl down both of her cheeks. She’s trying so hard not to cry about it. She folds her arms in where they’re covering her core, placing her hands on her elbows. I rub her arm with my hand.
            <br><br>
            “No,” she says, but she doesn’t pull away. We’ve done this a million times before over the years. “You can’t comfort me for your pain. It’s not fair.”
            <br><br>
            I continue rubbing her arm. I always struggle with this part. Adrie crying over my…situation… It’s not new. But I don’t usually cry about it, and that’s what makes this tough.
            <br><br>
            “We can be sad together, okay?” I cup the side of her face with my free hand. “Okay?”
            <br><br>
            “Yeah,” she nods. Our foreheads touch. I love her so much.
            <br><br>
            I don’t care that Adrie needs comforting about my situation. I want to be here for her, with her. No matter what it is. I try not to feel sad about my situation anyway. I’m not sure if I even really feel much about it at all, most days. That’s probably not great, but…I don’t see a reason in feeling things about something I can’t change.
            <br><br>
            I’ve never had power over anything in my life, except my own appearance. I can change the way I look. Whenever Adrie and I aren’t alone, I present wood elf. I only show as my true self when I’m with her. And that’s only for her. Adrie says she wants to be with me, as I am. Not how I look just to blend in.
            <br><br>
            Adrie has the kind of strength that helps her face the truth for exactly what it is. She can stomach just about anything that might otherwise make somebody go weak in the knees. For her, it’s not about overcoming the sight of something grotesque or gory. It’s about seeing it in a way that makes it beautiful.
            <br><br>
            When Adrie and I were walking through the woods once when we were kids, I stepped into a trap that closed around my calf and instantly mangled up my flesh. I was younger and had less control, so I immediately stopped showing wood elf in that moment and became the real me, with my pale grey skin tone, black hair, and sunken-in cheeks. That was the moment Adrie realized just how bad my situation was.
            <br><br>
            She untangled my leg from the trap and bandaged me up. I didn’t change back to a wood elf until we left the woods that day. We sat by the little river and talked about everything. What I was, why I was so skinny… In Adrie’s memory, that was the first time she knew for sure I was a changeling, but it didn’t surprise her then.
            <br><br>
            That’s also the day that Adrie decided to begin studying healing magic. Adrie always had a vision for the truth and a heart that yearned to make that truth into something nice. She could look at anything and find a way to make it good.
            <br><br>
            Even now, as she looks at me, she sees the love of her life. Not some battered weakling like I so often see myself.
            <br><br>
            As we’re getting closer to the end of the final trance hour tonight, we go back to kissing each other. We don’t want to end tonight thinking about things that neither of us can fix.
            <br><br>
            Before our time is over, we get dressed and whisper our goodbyes. One last kiss before Adrie slips back out into the hallway and off to her room. And there I am, alone as myself for the last time until she and I are alone again.
            <br><br>
            I shut my eyes tight and a single tear slips out. I wipe it away before it gets anywhere. When I open my eyes, I’ve hidden myself in the body of what I might look like if I’d been born a wood elf. If only I could have been so lucky.

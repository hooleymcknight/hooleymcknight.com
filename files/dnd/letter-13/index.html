        <p class="reading">
            Adrie,
            <br><br>
            This is our second night together. It feels wonderful and right but also so strange still. In a good way, I promise. I just haven’t adjusted yet.
        	<br><br>
            I never pictured this as part of our lives together. Traveling with this group. It was a means to an end for me but now that we’re overlapping the two, them and you… I kind of like it.
        	<br><br>
            I like the way Dearg defends us. I like the way you’re the only person who really likes C’yra somehow. I like the way you and Maeve really get along.
        	<br><br>
            I’m thinking about our day. Just processing it all I guess. You’re totally out, asleep. I missed this. The way you sleep like the world is perfect and peaceful. I wish I could but it’s fine that I do this. I’m just happy being next to you.
        	<br><br>
            Ahhhh you said that to me tonight and I’m still reeling. “By you.” That’s where you’re happy. This is ringing in my ears and it will be when I go to sleep.
        	<br><br>
            I’m glad we talked today. About what happened. You know I’ve not always been the best about facing things head on. But I really want to fix things with us Adrie. I don’t think it’s enough from me to just be here again after I was gone for so long. I need to really be better for you.
        	<br><br>
            I want you to feel safe with me. Safe from me. And secure… I want you to be able to wake up every day and know I’m going to be right there next to you. I can tell this doesn’t feel as easy as it did before but you’re still here anyway, and you say this is where you’re happy.
        	<br><br>
            Adrie, I’m going to work on myself every day. You’re giving me your trust as a gift so I’m going to earn it. Someday you’ll know without a doubt that I’ll never be happy if we’re not together in life. I feel so much more motivated than I normally do. I hope you know I’d do anything for you, babe.
        	<br><br>
            Including not punching C’yra in the face. Unless she starts making comments at you. She’s always getting into our shit and you’ve only been here for a couple of days. Abyss, she probably was eavesdropping when we were talking about that man at the beginning of our watch.
        	<br><br>
            She’s both nosy and secretive. She didn’t tell us about meeting Diesa the bird on her previous watch. Maeve told us but I really don’t think C’yra was going to say anything. Honestly I just don’t get how you like her. I know you see the best in things, and I really love that about you. We just haven’t seen anything good from C’yra yet. But...as always I trust you.
        	<br><br>
            On the plus side, it seems like Dearg took care of that rotting meat smell. I could tell that was bothering you. The walk to Naca was more pleasant with the lavender rotting meat.
        	<br><br>
            I’m still feeling off abou that circus yeti we saw. I don’t know. I wish we had been more...proactive. I think I’m just stuck in this mindset. I wish I was more open and brave.
        	<br><br>
            Well, within reason. If I needed another reason not to like C’yra, I can’t fucking believe she wanted to sacrifice us just to save some coin. She’s so selfish and greedy. I don’t trust her at all. I’m glad the rest of the group agreed to just pay the bandits for Otto. That’s a full ass town I don’t think we could sneak through or defend ourselves from.
        	<br><br>
            Hopefully everything goes smoothly tomorrow getting Otto. I feel good about our group overall. I think we should be okay.
        	<br><br>
            I think I’m going to try and get some sleep now. Here. “By you.” I love you so much Adrie.
            <br><br>
            -Sig
            <br><br><br>
            Well, that was shortlived. Dearg is so funny to me, even when he nearly burns down the whole camp. It was really nice what you did for those twig blights. I love how compassionate you are.
